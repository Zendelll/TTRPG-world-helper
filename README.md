# TTRPG-world-helper
App to help me with building my TTRPG world. Hope I won't abandon this project:)

In theory this project should help with world building. 
I hope to make flexible system to create hierarcy of entries, where every entry could be a different object (place, character, item, etc).
And also I want to create visual interface to create/change entries and to put some places on maps (if object is a place) to help with visualisation.
In final product I plan to create two different entrypoints for frontend - read-only for players and admin for GM.
